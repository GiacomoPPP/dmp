The datasets and the data extraction code come from the [topolearn](https://github.com/Boehringer-Ingelheim/topolearn) repository.

The credits to the DECT layer gives to its inventors, and was published in the [dect](https://github.com/aidos-lab/dect) repository.

Thanks to Professor [Bastian Rieck](https://bastian.rieck.me) for the valuable feedback.
